# Lab | SQL - Selection

## Introduction

Run your first SQL commands! In this lab, we will practice selecting and projecting data. You can finish all questions with only those clauses:
- `SELECT`
- `SELECT DISTINCT`
- `FROM`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `LIMIT`

Please submit your solutions in a text file `solutions.sql`.

## Challenge:

Assume that any `_id` columns are incremental, meaning that higher ids always occured after lower ids. For example, a client with a higher `client_id` joined the bank after a client with a lower `client_id`.

### 1. From the `client` table, what are the ids of the first 5 clients from `disrict_id` 1?

Result:
```
2
3
22
23
28
```


### 2. From the `client` table, what is the id of the last client from `district_id` 72?
Result:
```
13576
```

### 3. From the `loan` table, what are the 3 lowest amounts?
Result:
```
4980
5148
7656
```

### 4. From the `loan` table, what are the possible values for status, ordered alphabetically in ascending order?
Result:
```
A	
B	
C	
D
```

### 5. From the `loans` table, what is the `loan_id` of the highest payment received?
Result:
```
6312
```


### 6. From the `loans` table, what is the loan `amount` of the lowest 5 `account_id`s. Show the `account_id` and the corresponding `amount`
Result:
```
2	80952	
19	30276	
25	30276	
37	318480	
38	110736
```


### 7. From the `loans` table, which are the `account_id`s with the lowest loan `amount` have a loan `duration` of 60?
Result:
```
10954	
938	
10711	
1766	
10799
```


### 8. From the `order` table, what are the unique values of `k_symbol`?
Note: There shouldn't be a table name `order`, since `order` is reserved from the `ORDER BY` clause. You have to use backticks to escape the `order` table name.
Result:
```

LEASING	
POJISTNE	
SIPO	
UVER
```


### 9. From the `order` table, which are the `order_id`s from the client with the `account_id` 34?
Result:
```
29445	
29446	
29447
```


### 10. From the `order` table, which `account_id`s were responsible for orders between `order_id` 29540 and `order_id` 29560 (inclusive)?
Result:
```
88	
90	
96	
97
```


### 11. From the `order` table, what are the individual amounts that were sent to (`account_to`) id 30067122?
Result:
```
5123
```


### 12. From the `trans` table, show the `trans_id`, `date`, `type` and `amount` of the 10 first transactions from `account_id` = 793 in chronological order, from newest to oldest.
Result:
```
